Description: This study examines how mental and physical health conditions predict absenteeism among em- ployed adults, focusing on the role of prior mental illness diagnosis, current distress, and chronic physical health conditions. Key findings reveal sex-specific patterns: men show heightened ab- senteeism sensitivity to physical health declines, while women’s absence rates remain steady. Notably, both sexes with initial mental health diagnoses display reduced absences under high distress and physical health challenges, suggesting diagnosis may encourage proactive health management. These insights underscore the importance of mental health support in workplace policies.

Description: This paper analyzes the impact of mental illness on absenteeism among employed adults, using MEPS data from 2010 to 2014. The study estimates the effects of diagnosed mental illness on absenteeism, accounting for symptom severity and individual, family, regional, and macroeco- nomic factors. It also examines how job factors, including fringe benefits, influence absenteeism. Findings suggest that while fringe benefits may increase absenteeism initially, they help miti- gate the long-term impact of mental illness on absence, supporting the value of wellness-oriented benefits in enhancing productivity.

K. Vrona, “Mental Health and Employment Duration”

Description: Using duration analysis and a latent health demand model, this study examines the impact of mental health on labor market outcomes, specifically employment duration and the length of layoffs leading to long-term unemployment.
